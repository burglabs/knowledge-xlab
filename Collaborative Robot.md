>Collaborativ Robot Arms are 'designed to safely work alongside and in collaboration with a human. These arms can follow position commands like a traditional industrial robot, as well as take force commands to apply a given force or torque in/around a specified axis. In addition to standard programming, the robots have a freedrive mode for tactile programming.'
