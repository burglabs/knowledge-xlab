### Abstract

From the smart speaker sitting on your kitchen counter to generated chair designs inspiring product designers, AI is already all around us. It is being used in countless wonderful, creative, and challenging ways. As this fast-paced technology develops, it pushes the frontiers of every field; however, it inevitably raises new questions to consider in ethics, responsible AI, and authorship.

In this hands-on workshop we spent the first day going over machine learning basics and some inspiration of what machine learning art actually is. This included a small lecture about what to consider when co-creating with a machine that consumes thousands of pieces of data — especially when that data belongs to other people. Afterwards, we started to make our own AI art with Runway ML. This tool is perfect for beginners, because it makes machine learning accessible. It wasn’t long before the students could already play around with a model called Style Transfer.

On the second day, we mainly focused on StyleGAN2, a specific Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model which generates images and videos. Using StyleGAN2, we made our own latent walk videos. Another technique that we played with is projection, where you can take any image and project it into a trained model. The model tries to find the closest image it can generate to the one you chose.

### Review

In the workshop "How to Play Nice with Artificial Intelligence: Artist and AI Co-creation," students experimented with Lia Coleman, among others, using [[RunwayML]] to artificially create images. The workshop was an offer of the [[Xlab]] within the BurgLabs Spring Session 21.
