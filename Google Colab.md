## What is Google Colab?
Google Colab is a very special browser-based tool. It is multiple things at once:

- it's a code editor (like VSCode or Coda, but in the browser!)
- it's a way to explain and document your code (with comments between your code blocks)
- it's a very powerful computer (very useful for AI programs)

You use Google Colab to run so called "notebooks". These are programs that other people have written and which you can run on Google's computers.
Often, Machine Learning programs need very powerful computers to run and Google Colab offers this (mostly) for free.
