Welcome, you found the right place to dive into robotics :)

This is a collection of links to our own writings as well as external references and tutorials to get started with these.

There are many more robots than the well known industrial robot arms.

## Concepts

To get started with [#robotics](app://obsidian.md/index.html#robotics) (or specifically robotic arms) it is very useful and often necessary to understand various concepts, terms and techniques.

-   [[Inverse Kinematics]]
-  [[Forward kinematics]]
-   [[Robotic Singularity]]
-   [[Tool Center Point (TCP)]]
-   [[6 Degrees of Freedom]]
-   [[Frame]]
-   [[Plane]]

## Hardware

Elements of industrial robot arms (on the example of Universal Robots [UR5](UR5.md)/ [UR10](UR10.md) )

- 6 Axis called Joints (Base, Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist1-3)
- [[Control Box]]
- [[Teach Pendant]]
- [[End-of-Arm Tool]]
