## How to contribute
We are very happy for people to share their knowledge as well as document their projects on this knowledge base. Since the area of interest of the XLab is fairly wide, so will be this collection.
To coordinate all of this, we are using a so-called [[Git and Github|Git]] repository. Git is a free and open source version control system, which makes it very easy for many people to collaborate on source code and other text files, in our case mainly the markdown files behind this. To help us grow and maintain this knowledge base, you don't need to become an expert in git, just use the following guide to get started.

## Recommended setup
> Even though there are countless options to edit markdown files and synchronize them with git, this is our recommended setup for beginners and advanced users alike. If you have experience with alternative tools, feel free to use those.

1. Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - this will be your main editor.
2. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - this will give you an interface to sync the repository with your local computer. 

## Cloning the repository
[[Git and Github|Git]] allows you to *clone* any git repository to your local computer. As the name says, this creates a clone of all the folders and files at this particular time.
1. Open GitHub Desktop. 
2. Go to `file -> clone repository` and type in `burglabs/xlab-docs`.
3. Choose a local path where you want to save the repository.
4. Click `clone`. 
5. Done - you are ready to start using your local clone now! âœ¨ 

## Using Obsidian
Obsidian has a very useful `command palette`, which you can open by pressing `cmd/control + p` or clicking the symbol in the left toolbar. You can use this to find pretty much any command or menu item. 
1. The currently open notes-collection is called a vault in Obsidian. When you first open Obsidian, it might give you the option to `open folder as vault`. If not or you have already used it, type `open another vault` into the command palette to open the dialog again.
2. Navigate to the local repository clone, choose the `_notes` folder and confirm. 
3. Congratulations, you now have the local clone of the knowledge base openend in Obsidian**. Have fun exploring!

## Synchronising with GitHub
Synchronizing your or other people's changes (*commits*) is called *pushing* and *pulling* in git. 

### commits
A commit is an arbitrary amount of changes to files and folders, saved as a version in the repository. Ideally you should create a commit, whenever it makes sense to save something as another version. 

### pulling 
This allows you to update your local repository clone and download all the changes, that have been commited to the main repository since you cloned or last pulled it.
Ideally, you do this regularly to stay up to date. Especially before you start changing or adding content you should pull the latest remote version.
In GitHub Desktop you can do this by going to `Repository -> Pull`.
