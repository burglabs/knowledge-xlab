A Robot consists of rigid parts (called *links*) and connections between these links (called *joints*). The number of **Degrees of Freedom** (DoF) depends on the number of links and joints, as well as the types of joints.
Universal Robots ([[UR5]]/ [[UR10]]) as well as many other industrial robot arms have 6 DoF. They therefore can reach any point in a given space from any direction.
