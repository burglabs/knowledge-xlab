## This is us

The Xlab is part of the research platform [BurgLabs](https://burg-halle.de/burglabs) at Burg Giebichenstein University of Art and Design in Halle, Germany. We explore the artistic potentials of robotics and artificial intelligence.

For regular updates feel free to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/burg_xlab) and subscribe to our [newsletter](https://campus.burg-halle.de/xlab-mailings/lists/?p=subscribe&id=2).
Also check out the work of our colleagues at the [BioLab](https://burg-halle.de/burglabs/biolab) and [SustainLab](https://burg-halle.de/burglabs/sustainlab)

## About this project

We use this space, to organise information we accumulate during our research and teaching activies.

We hope it will be just as useful for our students to get started as well as as a source of information for fellow researchers and colleagues in our fields.

Since our perspective is always limited, we encourage and invite you to participate and contribute!

If you've never worked with [GitHub](https://burglabs.github.io/xlab-docs/#/tools/git) before, here are some tutorials and introductions. Don't hesitate, it's not that complicated! Check [the README](readme.md) and get started!
