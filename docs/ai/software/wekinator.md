## Wekinator

The [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/) is an open source software, created by Rebecca Fiebrink. It allows you to use machine learning to build new electronic musical instruments, computer visions, gesturally-controlled animations and games, and more.

The Wekinator builds models using supervised machine learning algorithms.
Without writing any programming code, the wekinator enables you to build completely new interactive systems. As **inputs** you can use any real-time input for example webcam input, game controllers, motion tracking, sensors connected to Arduino, audio
input. **Outputs** can be sent to any real-time process, such as music, animation, games, etc.
