## RunwayML

[RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/) is a free software platform making Machine Learning accessible to artists and designers. Founded in 2018, this software brings together some of the best machine learing algorithms for generative art and make them accessible through a simple and appealing interface. MLRunway offers the option to (re-)train popular machine learning models such as GPT-2 for text generation, StyleGAN for image synthesis, … and a large range of other interesting stuff!

## Wekinator

The [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/) is an open source software, created by Rebecca Fiebrink. It allows you to use machine learning to build new electronic musical instruments, computer visions, gesturally-controlled animations and games, and more.

The Wekinator builds models using supervised machine learning algorithms.
Without writing any programming code, the wekinator enables you to build completely new interactive systems. As **inputs** you can use any real-time input for example webcam input, game controllers, motion tracking, sensors connected to Arduino, audio
input. **Outputs** can be sent to any real-time process, such as music, animation, games, etc.

## Teachable Machine

[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is a web tool by google that makes it fast and easy to create machine learning models, no coding required. It allows you to train your own machine learning model to recognize objects or expressions using a webcam.

Funny and simple application to get started with Machine Learning.
