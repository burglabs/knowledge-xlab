## Rhino 3D and Grasshopper

Rhinoceros 3D, also known as “Rhino 3D”, or “Rhino”, is a computer-aided design software. Rhino is often used in architectural trades, industrial design, etc. as a 3d-modelling-tool with an extreme fast and accurate freeform geometry engine that
also supports point clouds and meshes.

Grasshopper is a visual programming language that is included in Rhino. Grasshopper allows designers and artists to build generative forms or generative art without knowledge of programming or scripting. Many of Grasshopper’s components are used to create 2D drawings or 3D geometry but this program can actually be used for many different applications. For example, we use a robot plug-in for Grasshopper to control a robot.

- Introduction

In the following part we give you some introductions on how to download and
install the robots plug-in for Grasshopper.

1. If you don't have Rhino 7 you can download a 90 day trial from: https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-windows/evaluation

2. Download the latest Robots plugin for Grasshopper from GitHub. Select the Robots.zip in the latest release: https://github.com/visose/Robots/releases

3. Download one or more robot libraries: [Robots/Libraries at master · visose/Robots · GitHub](https://github.com/visose/Robots/tree/master/Libraries)

4. Install the robots plug-in into Grasshopper:

Open Grasshopper, open file (1),special folders (2) then components folder (3).

Drag Robots.dll and Robots.gha into this folder.

Close Rhino 7 and restart the programme. Now you should see the robots
plug-in in Grasshopper.
