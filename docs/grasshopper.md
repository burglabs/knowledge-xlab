# Grasshopper

Grasshopper is a visual programming language that is included in [[rhino3d]]. Grasshopper allows designers and artists to build generative forms or generative art without knowledge of programming or scripting. Many of Grasshopperâ€™s components are used to create 2D drawings or 3D geometry but this program can actually be used for many different applications. For example, we use the [[grasshopper-robots-plugin]] to control a robot.
