# Fusion 360

Fusion 360 is a 3D CAD-Program made by Autodesk.  
It is cloud based, runs on Mac and Windows and while it has less features than more established CAD-Packages it is easy to learn for beginners.  
At BURG we have been teaching Fusion 360 for the last few Semesters.  

Here you can find all the materials for the beginner and advanced course during the winter-semester 2020/2021.  
The course was held in German.
