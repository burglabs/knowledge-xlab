# Grasshopper Robots Plugin

> If you don't have Rhino (version 6 or 7) on your computer you can [download a 90 day trial](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-windows/evaluation)

## Plugin Installation

- Download the latest Robots plugin for Grasshopper [from GitHub](https://github.com/visose/Robots/releases).
- Open Grasshopper, go to file (1),special folders (2) then components folder (3).
- Drag *Robots.dll* and *Robots.gha* into this folder. If you are on Windows, right click on both files and make sure they are *unlocked*.
- Restart Rhino. Now the robots plugin should be available in Grasshopper.

## Robot Libary
If you are working at BURG, you will need [the robot library](/assets/media/210420_XLab-Robot-Library.zip) for our robotic arms, otherwise browse through the robot libraries collected on [the plugin repository](https://github.com/visose/Robots/tree/master/Libraries)!
