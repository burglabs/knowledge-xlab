# XLab Knowledge Base
Hi there, welcome and nice to have you here! ðŸ‘‹

This knowledge base primarily focuses on information we accumulate during our research and teaching activies at [XLab](xlab.md). Our main topics are [AI](MOC-AI) and [Robotics](MOC-Robotics) in the contexts of art, design and architecture, however we expand into anything related, e.g. digital culture, digital tools, making and fabricationâ€¦ 

Obviously this is an every-growing and never-finished project and we are always looking for help. If you have expertise you would like to share, please check the [Readme](Readme.md) on how to contribute!

## Starting points aka. MOC
Since a growing network of knowledge can never be put into a linear structure in the long term, we do not even try to provide a navigation  that will take you to every corner of this knowledge base. 

Instead, we collectively compile starting points and collections, which might help certain people with certain questions to find and relate the relevant information. 

We call these **Maps of Content** or just **MOC**. An MOC is like a local map or navigation structure for a certain topic or part of our knowledge network. Whenever an area or group of topics grows beyond a certain scale or a specific path through the network is often required, it might be a good idea to create an MOC for these. 

These are the ones we currently think should be linked on the start page:

- [MOC Robotics](MOC-Robotics.md)
	- [Introduction to Robotics](introduction-to-robotics.md)
- [MOC AI](MOC-AI.md)
	- [Introduction to AI](introduction-to-ai.md)
	- [Understanding AI](understanding-ai.md)
	- [Understanding Machine Learning](machine-learning.md)
	- [Data & Datasets](data-datasets.md)
	- [Tools](ai-tools.md)
	- [Problems with AI](problems-with-ai.md)
	- [AI Artists](ai-artists.md)
	- [Thoughts on AI+Art](thoughts-ai-art.md)

## Exploration is key! ðŸ”­
Apart from these MOCs, we encourage you to explore and discover! Most articles densly link to others and will take you on a walk through knowledge space. If you don't know where to start, use the search function!
Whether you are looking for a specific piece of information or are just here to wander around - enjoy!
