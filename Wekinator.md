The [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/) is an open source software, created by Rebecca Fiebrink. It allows you to use machine learning to build new electronic musical instruments, gesturally-controlled animations, games and more.

The Wekinator builds models using supervised machine learning algorithms.
Without writing any programming code, the Wekinator enables you to build completely new interactive systems. As **inputs** you can use any real-time input, for example: webcam input, game controllers, motion tracking, sensors connected to Arduino or audio input. **Outputs** can be sent to any real-time process, such as music, animation, games, etc.
