A Universal Robot ([[UR5]]/ [[UR10]]) has 6 **degrees of freedom**. It therefore can reach any point in a given space from any direction. 
A Robot consists of rigid parts (called *links*) and connections between these links (called *joints*). The number of DOF depends on the number of links and joints, as well as the types of joints.
