A **teach pendant** is an interface between a human and an industrial robot arm. [[UR5]]and [[UR10]] can be switched on or off and be programmed with it. The teach pendant also provides information on the status of the robot arm and external devices. In addition to the touch screen, the pendant has an emergency stop, a button for the Freedrive mode and a USB interface.
