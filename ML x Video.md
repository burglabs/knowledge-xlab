title: ML x Video
---

Here we will show how [[Machine Learning]] (ML) can be applied on the **moving image** (video, film). It's about generating and manipulating images or whole video sequences. There are possible use cases in the field of media art, cinema, storytelling, video installations, music videos, GIF memes, and more!

## Useful operations on images

The following capabilities will most probably be integrated in popular image and video editing tools very soon.. Will we still call them "AI" then? 🤔

### ❇️ Greenscreening

### ❇️ Recoloring

### ❇️ Upscaling

### ❇️ 2D to 3D

![Parallax effect on Instagram by Cyril Diagne](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burglabs/knowledge-xlab/main/assets/media/cyril-diagne-2d3d.gif)

Machine Learning can infer depth information from a 2D image. With this information you can add various 3D effects to images, like this parallax effect made by [Cyril Diagne](https://github.com/cyrildiagne/instagram-3d-photo)

🤔 Some of these examples seem "magic" because they create more out of less: adding color information, increasing resolution, adding depth... But keep in mind that Machine Learning is based on statistics, the algorithms have "learned" from large amount of example footage what the probabilities for a specific depth/color/shape are. That makes them susceptible for [[bias]]. Keep that in mind when you work with these apparently objective tools!

## Deepfakes

A deepfake is when you "puppeteer" a target video (most often of a human being) with a source video. Here are a few examples:

Sassy Justice is a Youtube series made by the makers of South Park. Watch the full series [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/SassyJustice/videos)!

Here's a real-time example, "First order Kiss" by [Shardcore](http://www.shardcore.org/). He writes: "I tried lip-sync’ing to [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(Prince_song)) via [Avatarify](https://github.com/alievk/avatarify) and recording the results. Frame-rate is a bit crappy, but not bad for ‘real-time-processing’ The future of karaoke, perhaps?"

Here's a piece of video art by British artist [Libby Heaney](http://libbyheaney.co.uk) in which she plays with gender roles by becoming Elvis herself..

## New kinds of filters

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/260612034?h=1cf903469e" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
In "Gloomy Sunday" artist [Memo Akten](http://www.memo.tv/works/) plays with every day objects infront of the camera and turns them with ML into almost realistic images of waves and other nature phenomena.

🤔 As you can see these new kind of "filters" are doing more than just manipulating the "style" of an image, they seem to somehow manipulate the "semantics" of an image as well!



## Latent Space Walks

The [[latent space]] is a high dimensional mathematical space of possible representations (depending on your training data) that can be navigated. By walking the latent space we can create animations of organic change.

## Help with editing (and even storytelling?)

ML can also be used to assist you in the editing process by analysing your footage according to specific parameters (objects in the shot, angle, lightning, scenery, etc.)
