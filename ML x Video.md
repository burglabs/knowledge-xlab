Here we will show how [[Machine Learning]] (ML) can be applied on the _moving image_ (video, film). It's about generating and manipulating images or whole video sequences. There are possible use cases in the field of media art, cinema, storytelling, video installations, music videos, GIF memes, and more!

A few other keywords: synthetic videos, deepfake, ...

## Deepfakes

This is probably what comes to mind first. A deepfake is when you "puppeteer" a target video (most often of a human being) with a source video. Here are a few examples:

<iframe width="600" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCTM2lvm0QE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Sassy Justice is a Youtube series made by the makers of South Park. Watch the full series [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/SassyJustice/videos)!

Here's a real-time example:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/420596414?h=0f08061b90" width="300" height="300" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
"First order Kiss" by [Shardcore](http://www.shardcore.org/), he writes: "I tried lip-sync’ing to [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(Prince_song)) via [Avatarify](https://github.com/alievk/avatarify) and recording the results. Frame-rate is a bit crappy, but not bad for ‘real-time-processing’ The future of karaoke, perhaps?"

Here's a piece of video art by British artist [Libby Heaney](http://libbyheaney.co.uk) in which she plays with gender roles by becoming Elvis herself..

## New kinds of "filters"

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/260612034?h=1cf903469e" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
In "Gloomy Sunday" artist [Memo Akten](http://www.memo.tv/works/) plays with every day objects infront of the camera and turns them into almost realistic images of waves and other nature phenomena.

These new kind of "filters" are more than just manipulating the "style" of an image, they seem to somehow manipulate the "semantics" of an image as well!

## Useful operations on images
These capacities will most probably be integrated in popular image and video editing tools very soon.. Will we still call them "AI" then?

### Recoloring

### Upscaling

This classic video made in 1994 has been upscaled in 2021 from 480p to 1440p with Machine Learning

### 2D to 3D

Machine Learning can infer depth information from a 2D image. With this information you can add various 3D effects to your images, like this parallax effect made by [Cyril Diagne](https://github.com/cyrildiagne/instagram-3d-photo)

## Help with editing (and even storytelling?)

ML can also be used to assist you in the editing process by analysing your footage according to specific parameters (objects in the shot, angle, lightning, scenery, etc.)
