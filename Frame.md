A **frame** also called **feature** is a Cartesian coordinate system which can be defined by a [plane](plane.md). 
To orient itself in the world, the robot arm needs a frame of reference, which is usually the base frame. The position and orientation of the end-of-arm tool is defined by the tool frame or [[Tool Center Point (TCP)|TCP]] with respect to the base frame.
