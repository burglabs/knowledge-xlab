### Review
	
Robotic arms are multi-purpose machines, which are mainly used to paint, weld, sort, mill, glue or carry out all sorts of other complex but repetitive tasks across various industries. We at the [[Xlab]] and others at BURG and beyond have been exploring their potential uses in creative and artistic processes beyond the usual applications.
In the remote workshop Scene One, Take one...Upload! participants were given the opportunity to get to know the two collaborative robots used at BURG and learn to create custom programming for them. Over the course of 4 days, the students were introduced to all the necessary tools, techniques and concepts. During the workshop the robotic arms were equipped with LED lights and a fixed camera was used to create long-exposure light paintings, freezing the robotic motion in three-dimensional space. This provided the participants, even though they could not physically be in the same room, with immediate feedback and a way to quickly match their expectations, simulations and real-world results.
As a virtual space for learning and communication a custom Discord channel proved to be a flexible and productive environment. Since video, audio and chat communication were all bundled in one place, a lively togetherness emerged and questions, tips, scripts and the resulting light-paintings were shared and discussed even long after official workshop hours.
The workshop was an offer of the [[Xlab]] within the BurgLabs Spring Session 21.
